## NOTE

Few files here are in `csv` format and few are in `rar` format.

For the files in rar format, you can use `WinRAR` to extract the files into `csv`. Reason for compression is that Github does not allow files greater than 100MB to be uploaded as normal file.

Note that compression is done in **extreme manner with 6GB dictionary size**. Hence decompression might take some time and needs more RAM. 

You may try online extractor too [Aspose Extractor](https://products.aspose.app/zip/extract)

### Important

- `H1` is split into 4 parts, so while extracting **select those 4 parts together and then extract as a whole**. Similarly do the needful for `H2`, `H3` and so on.
