# Dataset cleaned from dalton dataset

The dataset has been gathered from Preprocessed folder of [dalton-dataset](https://github.com/prasenjit52282/dalton-dataset/tree/main/Processed) for further cleaning.

The cleaned data of all files is stored in `Cleaned` folder for conveinence.

In order to clean the data store entire `Preprocessed` folder and the `combiner.py` in the same directory and then run:

```bash
# Ensure python is installed
python combiner.py
```

All the csv files will be created in the name format `folder_name.csv` in the `Cleaned` folder i.e. `A1.csv, C1.csv,...`
